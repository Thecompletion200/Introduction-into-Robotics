Repository for Robotics Class at CU Boulder

Note: Due to the nature of private student classwork, not all projects are displayed here. The included code samples represent work completed during the course and provide illustrative examples of the concepts covered.

controllers Folder: This folder contains code implementations demonstrating various robotic behaviors.

worldImg Folder: This folder includes images and video samples showcasing the robot's performance in different simulated environments. Note that the images are not the worlds themselves but visual representations of the robot's activities within those worlds.
